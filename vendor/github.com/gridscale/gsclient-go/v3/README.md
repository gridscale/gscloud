# The gridscale Go Client

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/gridscale/gsclient-go.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/gridscale/gsclient-go) [![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/gridscale/gsclient-go)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/gridscale/gsclient-go)

This is a client for the gridscale API. It can be used to make an application interact with the gridscale cloud platform to create and manage resources.

## Preparation for Use

To be able to use this client a number of steps need to be taken. First a gridscale account will be required, which can be created [here](https://my.gridscale.io/signup/). Then an API-token [should be created](https://my.gridscale.io/APIs/).

## Installation

First the Go programming language will need to be installed. This can be done by using [the official Go installation guide](https://golang.org/doc/install) or by using the packages provided by your distribution.

Downloading the gridscale Go client can be done with the following go command:

    $ go get github.com/gridscale/gsclient-go/v3

## Using the gridscale Client

To be able to use the gridscale Go client in an application it can be imported in a go file. This can be done with the following code:

```go
import (
	"github.com/gridscale/gsclient-go/v3"
)
```

To get access to the functions of the Go client, a Client type needs to be created. This requires a Config type. Both of these can be created with the following code:

```go
//Using default config
config := gsclient.DefaultConfiguration("User-UUID", "API-token")

//OR Custom config
config := gsclient.NewConfiguration(
            "API-URL",
            "User-UUID",
            "API-token",
            false, //Set debug mode
            true, //Set sync mode
            500, //Delay (in milliseconds) between requests
            100, //Maximum number of retries
        )
client := gsclient.NewClient(config)
```

Make sure to replace the user-UUID and API-token strings with valid credentials or variables containing valid credentials. It is recommended to use environment variables for them.

## Using API endpoints

***Note: `context` has to be passed to all APIs of `gsclient-go` as the first parameter. In case you want to set timeout for a specific operation, you can pass a context with timeout (via `context.WithTimeout` or `context.WithDeadline`)

After having created a Client type, as shown above, it will be possible to interact with the API. An example would be the [Servers Get endpoint](https://gridscale.io/en/api-documentation/index.html#servers-get):

```go
ctx := context.Background()
servers := client.GetServerList(ctx)
```

For creating and updating/patching objects in gridscale, it will be required to use the respective CreateRequest and UpdateRequest types. For creating an IP that would be IPCreateRequest and IPUpdateRequest. Here an example:

```go
ctx := context.Background()
requestBody := gsclient.IPCreateRequest{
	Name:       "IPTest",
	Family:     gsclient.IPv6Type,
	Failover:   false,
	ReverseDNS: "my-reverse-dns-entry.tld",
	Labels:     []string{"MyLabel"},
}

client.CreateIP(ctx, requestBody)
```

For updating/scaling server resources you could use:

```go
myServerUuid := "[Server UUID]"
backgroundContext := context.Background()

// No hotplug available for scaling resources down, shutdown server first via ACPI
shutdownErr := client.ShutdownServer(backgroundContext, myServerUuid)
if shutdownErr != nil{
	log.Error("Shutdown server failed", shutdownErr)
	return
}

// Update servers resources
requestBody := gsclient.ServerUpdateRequest{
	Memory:          12,
	Cores:           4,
}

updateErr := client.UpdateServer(backgroundContext, myServerUuid, requestBody)
if updateErr != nil{
	log.Error("Serverupdate failed", updateErr)
	return
}

// Start server again
poweronErr := client.StartServer(backgroundContext, myServerUuid)
if poweronErr != nil{
	log.Error("Start server failed", poweronErr)
	return
}
```

What options are available for each create and update request can be found in the source code. After installing it should be located in:
```
~/go/src/github.com/gridscale/gsclient-go
```

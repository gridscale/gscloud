# gscloud

gscloud is a command-line tool that lets you manage your virtual infrastructure on [gridscale.io](https://gridscale.io).

gscloud is written in Go, so everything you need is just the gscloud binary. Compile it all by yourself or get the official release from the [release page](https://github.com/gridscale/gscloud/releases).

### Build from source

See [here](docs/source.md) on how to build gscloud from source.

## Configuration

You can use `gscloud make-config` to generate a new config file. Make sure to add your user ID and API token here.

Example config:

```yml
projects:
- name: default
  userId: 2727b9ab-65ff-4d1e-af5e-d08d682bd1fa
  token: 6eb139b3b6515515a6f358d3a635e9b38f05935782602d4fd5c1b5716af54526
- name: liveproject
  userId: 2727b9ab-65ff-4d1e-af5e-d08d682bd1fa
  token: 6eb139b3b6515515a6f358d3a635e9b38f05935782602d4fd5c1b5716af54526
  url: https://api.gridscale.io
```

## Kubernetes

You can use gscloud to retrieve the kubeconfig of your managed Kubernetes cluster. Here is an example configuration (`~/.kubeconfig/config`):

```yml
apiVersion: v1
clusters:
- cluster:
    certificate-authority-data: LS0tLS1CRUdJTiBDRVJUSUZJQ0FURS0tL
    server: https://185.102.93.54:6443
  name: k8s-1-15-5-gs0-de-vte1-bbm49m
contexts:
- context:
    cluster: k8s-1-15-5-gs0-de-vte1-bbm49m
    user: k8s-1-15-5-gs0-de-vte1-bbm49m-admin
  name: k8s-1-15-5-gs0-de-vte1-bbm49m-admin@k8s-1-15-5-gs0-de-vte1-bbm49m
current-context: k8s-1-15-5-gs0-de-vte1-bbm49m-admin@k8s-1-15-5-gs0-de-vte1-bbm49m
kind: Config
preferences: {}
users:
- name: k8s-1-15-5-gs0-de-vte1-bbm49m-admin
  user:
    exec:
      apiVersion: "client.authentication.k8s.io/v1beta1"
      command: $HOME/gscloud
      args:
        - "--config"
        - "$HOME/.config/gscloud/config.yaml"
        - "--project"
        - "test"
        - "kubernetes"
        - "cluster"
        - "exec-credential"
        - "--cluster"
        - "9489f3a7-c8f8-4b38-bc9b-aa472a1c0d2a"
```

## Exit codes

gscloud returns zero exit code on success, non-zero on failure. Following exit codes map to these failure modes:

1. The requested command failed.
2. Reading the configuration file failed.
3. The configuration could not be parsed.
4. The project specified does not exist in the configuration file.

## Shell completions

Generate shell completion scripts for zsh and bash.

* bash

```shell
$ gscloud completion bash >> ~/.bash_profile
```

* zsh

```shell
$ gscloud completion zsh >> ~/.zshrc
```

## Install man-pages

Generate man-pages and install them. Example:

```shell
$ sudo gscloud manpage /usr/local/share/man/man1/
```
